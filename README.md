# Vent Control

A simple room ventilation controller using my other project [ESP32 DS18B20 Web API](https://github.com/execvpe/esp32-ds18b20-webapi)

## Behavior

This program monitors the current room temperature and warns you when it gets too cold.

**SIP functionality is not implemented yet!**

## Build

- Download and extract [PJLIB](https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/releases)

- Move the folder to the root of the project or change the PJPATH variable in *Makefile*


```
make init
```
After successful initialization you will be prompted to install the library. Please do as prompted.
```
make
```

## Usage

    ./vent-control

You may want to start the program with ```screen``` so you can detach the console.
